            <li>Fill out a short form with your first name, last name, and email</li>
            <li>You'll receive a unique referral link to share with startups</li>
            <li>Any startup that applies through your link will be automatically tracked.</li>

      question: "What counts as a qualified Summer of Rho referral?",
      answer: (
        <div>
          <p>A referral is considered qualified for the Summer of Rho competition if the referred startup applies for and opens a Rho account, and maintains an average daily balance of $350,000 for 90 days from the account opening date. Once these criteria are met, your referral count on the leaderboard will increase by one.</p>
          <p>However, eligibility is contingent on the referred company sustaining that $350,000 average daily balance throughout the 90-day verification period. If the balance falls below that amount at any point during this time, the referral will no longer qualify, and the $1,000 payout will not be awarded.</p>
          <p>All referrals will be audited after the competition ends. Rho reserves the right to adjust leaderboard totals and payout amounts based on the final verification. It's important to note that the leaderboard is intended for informational purposes only and will not serve as the official count for determining the Grand Prize and Second Prize winners.</p>
          <p>Additionally, only referrals submitted on or after July 2, 2025, and before the end of the contest will be considered for the Summer of Rho competition.</p>
        </div>
      )
    },
    {
      question: "Who is eligible to participate in Summer of Rho?",
      answer: (
        <div>
          <p>To be eligible to participate in the Summer of Rho competition and qualify for prizes, you must refer a minimum number of qualified startups. Specifically, you need to refer at least 10 qualified startups to be eligible for the Grand Prize, and at least 5 to be eligible for the Second Prize.</p>
          <p>There is a limit on how many referrals can be counted per UBO (ultimate beneficial owner). Only two referred startups per UBO will count toward your qualified referral total. In the case of a tie for first place, the participant whose referrals bring in the most total deposits will win.</p>
          <p>The Summer of Rho competition may be combined with other offers or promotions organized by Rho, as long as you meet the terms and conditions of those additional programs.</p>
        </div>
      )
    },
    {
      question: "When can I expect this to payout?",
      answer: (
        <div>
          <p>All referral payouts for the Summer of Rho, including the final tallies for the Grand Prize and the Second Prize, are subject to a 90-day balance verification period. Each referred company must maintain an average daily balance of $350,000 throughout this period in order to qualify.</p>
          <p>Once the 90-day requirement is met and verified, the $1,000 referral bonuses will be paid out promptly. If a referred company's balance drops below $350,000 at any point during the verification period, that referral will no longer qualify for the payout or count toward your progress toward the Grand Prize or Second Prize.</p>
          <p>Leaderboard rankings are updated weekly for informational purposes, but they're preliminary and subject to change. Final rankings and payouts will be determined after a full audit at the end of the competition.</p>

                Entry into the Contest is open only to employees or authorized personnel of legal entities that are verified as startups by Sponsor and have successfully completed Sponsor's Know Your Customer verification process. In determining whether a legal entity qualifies as a startup, Sponsor will evaluate factors including, but not limited to, the entity's age, revenue, and funding status, at Sponsor's sole discretion. Employees or authorized personnel of legal entities must be legal residents of the fifty (50) States of the United States of America and the District of Columbia who are at least twenty-one (21) years of age at the time of entry.

                  <strong>Submission:</strong> Entrants that are eligible for this Contest can sign up for the Contest using the Contest's landing page at summerofrho.com. Entrants will then be provided a custom online link that they can send to other U.S.-based corporate entities that are deemed as startups by Sponsor based on criteria including, but not limited to, company age, revenue, and funding status, as determined by Sponsor at its sole discretion, to submit themselves as a "Potential Referral." In addition, at most two (2) entities that are under the control of the same ultimate beneficial owner ("UBO") registered with Sponsor will count as Potential Referrals during this Contest. Additional entities controlled by the same UBO, even if submitted with the referral link of another entrant, will not count as Potential Referrals. All Potential Referral submissions will be routed to an appropriate Sponsor sales team member to determine a Potential Referral's eligibility to open a deposit account with a Sponsor Bank (as defined in Rho's Terms of Service) through the Rho Services (as defined in Rho's Terms of Service) ("Rho Checking Account") and/or to open a Rho Treasury Account (as defined in Rho's Terms of Service).
                </p>
                <p className={styles.disclaimerText}>
                  <strong>Deposits:</strong> If that Potential Referral opens a Rho Checking Account and/or Rho Treasury Account and maintains an average deposit balance of $350,000 or more in that account or across both accounts for ninety (90) days after the opening of that account ("Deposit Balance"), the Potential Referral may be deemed as an "Qualified Referral" for that entrant. Sponsor will determine, at its sole discretion, whether a Potential Referral qualifies as an Qualified Referral based on the criteria outlined above, including account opening and maintaining the required Deposit Balance.
                </p>
                <p className={styles.disclaimerText}>
                  <strong>Credit for Submission:</strong> Once an entity is submitted as a Potential Referral by an entrant, that entity may no longer be eligible to be submitted as a Potential Referral by another entrant. The earliest submission of a Potential Referral by an entrant that is received by Sponsor shall receive credit for that submission. It is at Sponsor's sole discretion to judge the assignment of credit to an entrant for a submission of a Potential Referral.
                </p>
                <p className={styles.disclaimerText}>
                  <strong>Leaderboard:</strong> During the Contest Period, Sponsor shall maintain a leaderboard that depicts the number of submissions of Potential Referrals from entrants with the most submissions. Entrants shall be identified by their first names and the first letter of their last names. The leaderboard will be updated periodically by Sponsor. However, the final count of Qualified Referrals will not be determined until the final verification by Sponsor of their eligibility at the end of their 90-day periods. All information presented by the leaderboard is preliminary and will not be used by Sponsor to determine the Contest awards.

                  <strong>Limit:</strong> There is no limit to the total number of Potential Referrals that an entrant can submit during the Contest Period.

                <p className={styles.disclaimerText}>
                  <strong>Other Offers:</strong> This Contest may be combined with any other promotions or offers organized by Sponsor, subject to their terms and conditions. Potential Referrals submitted through the Contest's referral links will be evaluated for their eligibility for those separate promotions by a Sponsor sales team member. Eligibility will be determined by those promotions' respective terms and conditions and will not affect eligibility for this Contest. Potential Referrals will be eligible for the awards provided by those promotions in addition to any prizes awarded from this Contest.

              <h4 className={styles.disclaimerSubtitle}>6. Prize Restrictions and Requirements</h4>
              <p className={styles.disclaimerText}>
                Each entrant/entity is limited to the available number of prizes as described in Section 5 (Prize) and Section 7 (Winner Selection Process). Prizes are non-transferable and no substitution will be made except in Sponsor's sole discretion. Sponsor will not replace any lost or stolen prizes. Sponsor reserves the right to substitute a prize for one of equal or greater value if the designated prize should become unavailable for any reason. The value associated with each prize is taxable as income and each winner is solely responsible for any taxes and associated costs, including, but not limited to all applicable federal, state and local taxes that become due with respect to the value of each prize. The Sponsor must report the value of each prize to the Internal Revenue Service in the year a prize is received by the winner and will be reported to the winner and the Internal Revenue Service in the form of a Form 1099. Each winner is also responsible for any fees associated with their prize receipt and/or use, and any other costs or expenses not expressly listed in these Rules. Prizes must be redeemed within the period of notification of winning as set forth below.
              </p>
              <h4 className={styles.disclaimerSubtitle}>7. Winner Selection Process</h4>
              <div className={styles.disclaimerText}>
                <p className={styles.disclaimerText}>
                  After the end of the Contest Period, Sponsor will assess the total number of Qualified Referrals made by each entrant during the Contest Period. The determination of whether a Potential Referral qualifies as an Qualified Referral shall be made at the end of the 90-day period following the opening of its Rho Checking Account and/or Rho Treasury Account and the initial deposit of its required Deposit Balance. Any Potential Referral that did not maintain the Deposit Balance throughout this 90-day period shall be ineligible for any Contest prizes, and the entrant that submitted this Potential Referral shall not receive credit towards its progress for the Grand Prize or the Second Prize.
                </p>
                <p className={styles.disclaimerText}>
                  The entrant with the highest number of Qualified Referrals shall be awarded the Grand Prize. The entrant must have made at least ten (10) Qualified Referrals to be eligible. If multiple entrants have the same highest number of credited Qualified Referrals, the aggregate amounts of Deposit Balances made by the entrants' Qualified Referrals will be used as a tiebreaker. For example, if two entrants are both credited with thirty (30) Qualified Referrals, the entrant whose Qualified Referrals made an aggregate amount of Deposit Balance totaling $20,000,000 will win the Grand Prize over the entrant whose Qualified Referrals made an aggregate amount of Deposit Balance totaling $18,000,000. The latter entrant will be given the Second Prize, if eligible, as a result.
                </p>
                <p className={styles.disclaimerText}>
                  The entrant with the second highest number of Qualified Referrals, or the runner-up of a tiebreaker for the Grand Prize, shall be awarded the Second Prize. The entrant must have made at least five (5) Qualified Referrals to be eligible. If multiple entrants have the same second highest number of credited Qualified Referrals, including as nonwinners of a tiebreaker for the Grand Prize, the aggregate amounts of Deposit Balances made by the entrants' Qualified Referrals will be used as a tiebreaker. For example, if two entrants are both credited with twenty (20) Qualified Referrals, the entrant whose Qualified Referrals made an aggregate amount of Deposit Balance totaling $15,000,000 will win the Second Prize over the entrant whose Qualified Referrals made an aggregate amount of Deposit Balance totaling $13,000,000. The latter entrant(s) will receive only the referral bonus, if eligible, described in Section 7.4, as a result.
                </p>
                <p className={styles.disclaimerText}>
                  All entrants shall be awarded with a referral bonus that is equal to $1,000 per Qualified Referral made. Entrants do not need to make a minimum number of Qualified Referrals to be eligible for this referral bonus.
                </p>
                <p className={styles.disclaimerText}>
                  All submitted Potential Referrals that are deemed as Qualified Referrals shall be credited with $1,000 to their Rho Checking Account.

                <p className={styles.disclaimerText}>

If an entrant that is eligible for the Grand Prize or the Second Prize is disqualified for any reason, then their prize may be awarded to the entrant with the next most Qualified Referrals, if any, at Sponsor's sole discretion. If an eligible entrant's Second Prize is upgraded to a Grand Prize in this manner, then they will no longer be eligible for this initial Second Prize, which may be awarded to the entrant with the next most Qualified Referrals, if any, at Sponsor's sole discretion.
